## What Are AI-Generated Skills?

AI-generated skills are agent skills (following the [SKILL.md specification](https://agentskills.io/)) that were created with the assistance of Large Language Models (LLMs) rather than being written entirely by human experts.

In this repository, all skills were generated using **Claude Opus 4.5** with human oversight and review.

## Why Use AI to Generate Skills?

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Rapid prototyping** | AI can quickly draft comprehensive skill structures |
| **Consistency** | AI maintains consistent formatting and structure across skills |
| **Coverage** | AI can synthesize information from many sources to create broad guidance |
| **Accessibility** | Enables creation of skills in domains where human expertise is expensive or scarce |

## Key Limitations

AI-generated skills have important limitations that users must understand:

### 1. No Substitution for Expertise

The skills in this repository were generated by AI, not written by domain experts. The author:

- Is **not a lawyer** - legal skills provide general guidance, not legal advice
- Is **not a domain expert** in all covered areas

### 2. Potential for Errors

AI-generated content may contain:

- **Factual inaccuracies** - AI can "hallucinate" plausible but incorrect information
- **Outdated information** - Training data has a cutoff date
- **Oversimplifications** - Complex topics may be inadequately covered
- **Missing edge cases** - AI may not anticipate all scenarios

### 3. No Real-World Validation

Many skills are marked as `experimental` because they have not been:

- Tested in production environments
- Validated by domain experts
- Used in real-world scenarios

## How to Use AI-Generated Skills Responsibly

### Do

- **Verify critical information** with authoritative sources
- **Consult professionals** for legal, medical, financial, or academic matters
- **Test thoroughly** before relying on skill guidance
- **Report errors** you discover to help improve the skills
- **Check the `status` field** - prefer `tested` skills over `experimental` ones

### Don't

- **Don't treat as authoritative** - these are assistance tools, not expert guidance
- **Don't skip verification** - always cross-reference important decisions
- **Don't assume completeness** - skills may not cover all aspects of a topic
- **Don't ignore disclaimers** - each skill has specific limitations noted

## Transparency Metadata

The [SKILL.md specification](https://agentskills.io/specification) only requires `name` and `description` fields. This repository uses additional extended metadata for AI transparency.

> **Note:** We have proposed these extended metadata fields to the official specification in [anthropics/skills#180](https://github.com/anthropics/skills/issues/180).

```yaml
---
# Required by specification
name: skill-name
description: "What the skill does"

# Extended metadata (optional, used in this repository)
version: "1.0.0"
status: tested | experimental
author: "Human maintainer"
generated_by: "Claude Opus 4.5"
license: MIT
disclaimer: "Skill-specific limitations..."
---
```

See [AI Transparency Metadata](../ai-limitations/#ai-transparency-metadata-for-skills) for detailed field descriptions.

## Skill Status Definitions

| Status | Meaning | Recommendation |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| `tested` | Has been reviewed and tested in limited scenarios | Suitable for general use with verification |
| `experimental` | Draft quality, minimal testing | Use with caution, expect issues |
