## Geographic Considerations

### Moral Rights (France/EU)

In France and most EU countries, authors have inalienable moral rights:
- Right of attribution (paternité)
- Right of integrity (respect de l'oeuvre)
- Right of disclosure (divulgation)
- Right of withdrawal (retrait)

These cannot be waived by license, even with CC0.

### Fair Use (United States)

The US fair use doctrine allows some unlicensed use for:
- Criticism and commentary
- News reporting
- Teaching and research
- Parody

Factor analysis: purpose, nature, amount, market effect.

### Public Domain Variations

Public domain status varies by country:
- Works may be public domain in US but not EU
- Duration differs (life + 70 years EU, varies elsewhere)
- CC0 provides fallback license for jurisdictions without public domain concept
